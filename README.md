This branch uses Docker and MariaDB to run Racu. It has the exact same functionality within Discord.
There is an ".env.template" file, please copy it to `.env` and fill out the details if you want to host Racu yourself.

Beware that this branch is much more complicated than the main branch with sqlite3 & PM2, however it is more suitable if you plan to host Racu on a major scale with thousands or millions of Discord servers.
