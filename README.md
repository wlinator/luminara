# Racu Discord Bot

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information

Racu is a Discord bot originally developed for a specific server, but it can now be used anywhere as a self-hosted Python project. 
**Please note that the main Racu bot is no longer available for server invitations.**


## üé® Features

- XP System: Earn experience points (XP) with amusing and sometimes sarcastic level-up messages (can be disabled).
- Economy System: Engage in various economy-related activities, including:
  - Blackjack
  - Slots
  - Duels
  - Daily Rewards to keep players engaged
- Simple Moderation Module: Manage server moderation tasks.
- Currency and Level Stats: Track user currency and levels.
- Server Introductions: Automatically post server introductions in a designated channel.
- Reaction Handler: Customize bot reactions to specific messages.


## üì≤ Installation
Racu is containerized: its core, database and db admin platform run on Docker without any extra configuration. 
However, you CAN run it locally without Docker by hosting MariaDB on your machine with the login credentials specified in [.env](.env.template) and installing **Python 3.11** with the [required pip packages](requirements.txt). **Note: I won't explain how to do this. Figure it out on your own.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Dok4440/racu && cd racu
```

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill out the [variables](#env-keys).   

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment variables

- `OWNER_ID`: the Discord user ID of the person who will act as owner of this bot.
- `XP_GAIN`: a comma-seperated list of XP gain values, Racu randomly picks one on each message.

- The values with "DBX" can be ignored unless you plan to make database backups with Dropbox. In that case enter your Dropbox API credentials.
